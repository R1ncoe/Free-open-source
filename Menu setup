Changing the menu images Inside the Tweak.xm, you'll setup the menu under the function "setupMenu". Here you'll see two options under the menu: menuIcon & menuButton, those require a base64 image string. In order to get a base64 string from the image, upload the image here: https://www.browserling.com/tools/image-to-base64

Images 50x50 are recommended, you can get a sample of my images by copying the standard(in tweak.xm) base64 string & use this website to show the picture: https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image

Setting a framework as executable You can set this in the function setupMenu() inside Tweak.xm

[menu setFrameworkName:"FrameworkName"];
